# Getting Started with Create React App and deploying to AWS

In this module, we’ll begin by creating a new React application and push it to a GitHub repository. Then, we will connect the repository to AWS Amplify web hosting and deploy it to a globally available content delivery network (CDN) hosted on an amplifyapp.com domain. Next, we’ll demonstrate continuous deployment capabilities by making changes to the React application and push a new version to the master branch which will automatically kick off a new deployment.

What You Will Learn
Create a React application
Initialize a GitHub repository
Deploy your app with AWS Amplify
Implement code changes and redeploy your app

## Key Concepts
API – Provides a programming interface that allows communication and interactions between multiple software intermediaries.

GraphQL – A query language and server-side API implementation based on a typed representation of your application. This API representation is declared using a schema based on the GraphQL type system. (To learn more about GraphQL, visit this page.)

## Deploy your app with AWS Amplify
In this step, you will connect the GitHub repository you just created to the AWS Amplify service. This will enable you to build, deploy, and host your app on AWS.

a. In the AWS Amplify service console, select "Get Started" under Deploy.
