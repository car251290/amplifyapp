# Getting Started with Create React App and deploying to AWS

In this module, we’ll begin by creating a new React application and push it to a GitHub repository. Then, we will connect the repository to AWS Amplify web hosting and deploy it to a globally available content delivery network (CDN) hosted on an amplifyapp.com domain. Next, we’ll demonstrate continuous deployment capabilities by making changes to the React application and push a new version to the master branch which will automatically kick off a new deployment.
