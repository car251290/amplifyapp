# Getting Started with Create React App and deploying to AWS

In this module, we’ll begin by creating a new React application and push it to a GitHub repository. Then, we will connect the repository to AWS Amplify web hosting and deploy it to a globally available content delivery network hosted on an amplifyapp.com domain. Next, we’ll demonstrate continuous deployment capabilities by making changes to the React application and push a new version to the master branch which will automatically kick off a new deployment.

Single page web apps offer native or desktop app-like performance. They offer all the static website benefits (low cost, high levels of reliability, no server adminstration, and scalability to handle enterprise-level traffic) with dynamic functionality and blazing fast performance.

## How AWS works
AWS is separated into different services; each can be configured in different ways based on the user's needs. Users should be able to see configuration options and individual server maps for an AWS service.

## What I Will Learn
Create a React application
Initialize a GitHub repository
Deploy your app with AWS Amplify
Implement code changes and redeploy your app

# AWS Lambda 
it is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster
You can set up your code to automatically trigger from 140 AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

# AWS Amplify 
full stack applications, powered by AWS. With Amplify, you can configure app backends and connect your app in minutes, deploy static web apps in a few clicks, and easily manage app content outside the AWS console.


## Key Concepts
API – Provides a programming interface that allows communication and interactions between multiple software intermediaries.
without this API the application will be so different and cannot get data

GraphQL – A query language and server-side API implementation based on a typed representation of your application. This API representation is declared using a schema based on the GraphQL type system. (To learn more about GraphQL, visit this page.

React application – React is a web application framework that enables developers to quickly build performant single page applications using JavaScript.
Git – A version control system that allows developers to store files as well as maintain and update relationships between files and directories, versions, and changes to the files.

## Deploy your app with AWS Amplify
In this step, you will connect the GitHub repository you just created to the AWS Amplify service. This will enable you to build, deploy, and host your app on AWS.
a. In the AWS Amplify service console, select "Get Started" under Deploy.

## Automatically deploy code changes
In this step, you will make some changes to the code using your text editor and push the changes to the master branch of your app.
software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.
## Successful deploy
AWS Amplify will now build your source code and deploy your app at https://...amplifyapp.com.
 Once the build completes, select the thumbnail to see your web app up and running live.
 
## Automatically deploy code changes

a. Edit src/App.js with the code below and save.

 ## Conclusion
You have deployed a React application in the AWS Cloud by integrating with GitHub and using AWS Amplify. With AWS Amplify, you can continuously deploy your application in the cloud and host it on a globally-available CDN.
